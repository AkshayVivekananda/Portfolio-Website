                    <h2>Obstacle Avoiding Robot</h2>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">Obstacle-avoiding robots are autonomous devices designed to navigate their environment while intelligently circumventing obstacles. Equipped with sensors such as ultrasonic or infrared modules, these robots detect obstacles in their path and employ decision-making algorithms, often implemented on microcontrollers, to adjust their course. The sensors provide real-time data, allowing the robot's actuators—typically motors or servos—to dynamically modify its trajectory, avoiding collisions. The design encompasses a sturdy mechanical structure, a reliable power source, and often involves wireless communication for remote control or data transmission. These robots find applications in diverse fields, including industrial automation, surveillance, and search and rescue operations, showcasing their adaptability and versatility. The development of obstacle-avoiding robots involves careful calibration and testing to ensure effective obstacle detection and navigation in various environments.</p>
